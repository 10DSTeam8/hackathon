4.1 An Integrated Model of External Influences on DNA Rates

The preceding analysis has deconstructed the complex and often underestimated impact of meteorological conditions and
travel disruptions on NHS hospital 'Did Not Attend' rates. The evidence demonstrates that these external factors are not
minor inconveniences but are, in fact, significant, quantifiable, and predictable drivers of non-attendance. They impose
substantial costs on the health service, waste finite clinical capacity, and ultimately delay care for patients.
This report has established a working national baseline DNA rate of 7.0% and has quantified the proportional
contribution of each external factor. Weather, encompassing everything from extreme heat and cold to severe snow events,
is estimated to be a direct cause in approximately 4.5% of all DNAs. Travel disruption, a broader category that includes
both acute events like transport strikes and the chronic, pervasive barriers of cost and poor accessibility, is
estimated to account for a significantly larger share, contributing to approximately 15% of all DNAs.

Table 4: Summary of External Factors and Estimated Impact on National DNA Rate
It is critical to recognise that these factors often interact and compound one another. A day with heavy snowfall that
coincides with disruptions to bus services will have a multiplicative, not merely additive, effect on the DNA rate,
particularly for elderly or low-income patients who have limited alternative travel options. This integrated
understanding moves the issue of DNAs beyond a simple question of patient responsibility and reframes it as a complex
logistical challenge that requires a sophisticated, data-driven, and system-level response.
